Hello, my name is Michael.


I don't really do much stuff here. All I really do is make random stuff and put it here. 
\
I'm keen to learn more things about tech and programming itself.
Currently, I'm learning C++ and Web Development. I'm also interested in learning more just about what I like to get my hands on. ðŸŒ±


Other than that, I mostly do stuff that is not related to programming.
I like to learn Japanese, play games (not much any more), listen to music and explore topics outside my comfort zone.
ðŸš€
